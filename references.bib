abstract = "Functional connectomes reveal biomarkers of individual
psychological or clinical traits. However, there is great
variability in the analytic pipelines typically used to derive
them from rest-fMRI cohorts. Here, we consider a specific type of
studies, using predictive models on the edge weights of
functional connectomes, for which we highlight the best modeling
choices. We systematically study the prediction performances of
models in 6 different cohorts and a total of 2000 individuals,
encompassing neuro-degenerative (Alzheimer's, Post-traumatic
stress disorder), neuro-psychiatric (Schizophrenia, Autism), drug
impact (Cannabis use) clinical settings and psychological trait
(fluid intelligence). The typical prediction procedure from
rest-fMRI consists of three main steps: defining brain regions,
representing the interactions, and supervised learning. For each
step we benchmark typical choices: 8 different ways of defining
regions -either pre-defined or generated from the rest-fMRI data-
3 measures to build functional connectomes from the extracted
time-series, and 10 classification models to compare functional
interactions across subjects. Our benchmarks summarize more than
240 different pipelines and outline modeling choices that show
consistent prediction performances in spite of variations in the
populations and sites. We find that regions defined from
functional data work best; that it is beneficial to capture
between-region interactions with tangent-based parametrization of
covariances, a midway between correlations and partial
correlation; and that simple linear predictors such as a logistic
regression give the best predictions. Our work is a step forward
to establishing reproducible imaging-based biomarkers for
clinical settings.",
