  abstract = "The functional architecture of the object vision pathway in the
              human brain was investigated using functional magnetic resonance
              imaging to measure patterns of response in ventral temporal cortex
              while subjects viewed faces, cats, five categories of man-made
              objects, and nonsense pictures. A distinct pattern of response was
              found for each stimulus category. The distinctiveness of the
              response to a given category was not due simply to the regions
              that responded maximally to that category, because the category
              being viewed also could be identified on the basis of the pattern
              of response when those regions were excluded from the analysis.
              Patterns of response that discriminated among all categories were
              found even within cortical regions that responded maximally to
              only one category. These results indicate that the representations
              of faces and objects in ventral temporal cortex are widely
              distributed and overlapping.",
